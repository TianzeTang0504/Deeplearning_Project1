Download data from Kaggle and put the unzipped folder in './data'.

Run 'deep_resnet.py' and 'model_unet.py' to see the number of parameters.

Run 'preprocessing.py' and 'test_preprocessing.py' to prepare the data.

Run 'main_cutmix.py' to train the model.

Run 'pred.py' to get the final csv file.

Under rtx4090 and R7 7700, it needs about 67 min to complete the train.
